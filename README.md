# D3-Project

Our goal was to reproduce a Radial Stacked Bar Chart using new data collected from the USGS related to location, frequency, and magnitude of earthquakes from January 1-January 31, 2021. 
The original code to create a Radial Stacked Bar Chart can be found at: https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart. The files taken from that site are in the "Original Code" folder. Our attempt to recreate the chart with the USGS data can be found in the "Attempt 1" Folder.
